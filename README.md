# Melodex - Playlist Transferrer (Youtube/Spotify for now)
Melodex is a web application that allows users to seemlessly transfer their playlists between different music services in seconds.

## Live Demo
‚ùó Due to Youtuba Data API's quota limit, a little less than 200 songs can be added to Youtube playlists per day. Because of this, transferring to Youtube is not available the live version to avoid potential rate limits.

## Tech Stack

### FrontEnd
- React with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn/UI

### Backend
- Express.js + Express Session
- Youtube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)
- Youtube Search API (https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-search-api)
- Spotify Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

## Future Improvements
- Implement functionality for Apple Music and SoundCloud
- Saving the playlists to add (playlist names and songs) in a more secure way
- Accounting for when a song has multiple version
- Accounting for very large playlists (difficult to test this due to the Youtube Data API limits mentioned above)
